if (Player.m_localPlayer != null)
{
    Biomes = (int)Player.m_localPlayer.GetCurrentBiome();
}

        None = 0,
        Meadows = 1,
        Swamp = 2,
        Mountain = 4,
        BlackForest = 8,
        Plains = 16,
        AshLands = 32,
        DeepNorth = 64,
        Ocean = 256,
        Mistlands = 512,
if (Biomes == 1)
{
your code
}

if (Biomes == 2)
{
your code
}
